- 👋 Hi, I’m @ChrisWade1
- 👀 I’m interested in Python programming. I've been programming for a couple of years on and off so my learning is rather slow.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning, ha…if you guessed Python, top 'o tha' class. Got a smattering of VBA, batch files, I guess most of the usual learning "stuff".
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on whatever, nothing specific.
- 📫 How to reach me: chriswadehome@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: Oh hell no, not now, not ever. I'm a guy and you can just call me by my name, which is Chris, as if you haven't already guessed.
- ⚡ Fun fact: "The programmer did it with a keyboard in the conservatory."
